Digits 0, 4, and 7 are the most frequently appearing individual digits with 22, 21, and 21 counts respectively. The pair digit '7' shows the highest frequency with 13 occurrences, closely followed by '6' (12) and '4' (11). Repeating numbers, such as 33, 44, 88, and 99, were observed 5 times within this dataset."

      "summary": "For the upcoming draw, we predict '72', '01', and '16' as hot numbers, based on their high frequency in recent results, especially '72' which appeared 4 times. Conversely, '00', '20', and '30' are considered cold numbers, as they have been absent or very rare in the recent data, making them potentially due. The key digit for the next draw is anticipated to be '0', given its overall highest frequency (22 times) in the historical data, suggesting a strong likelihood of its appearance. Additionally, the pair digit '7' is the most probable (13 occurrences), following its consistent appearance as the sum of digits' last digit. This forecast leans towards low, even numbers, with a strong emphasis on digits '0' and '7'."
