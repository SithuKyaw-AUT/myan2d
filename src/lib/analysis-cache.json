The digit '7' is the most frequent overall with 21 occurrences, followed closely by '1' and '4' with 19 each, while '3' and '9' are among the least frequent. In terms of pair digits, '0' and '1' are the most common, both appearing 11 times, contrasting with '9' which appeared only 4 times. Repeating numbers were observed 6 times in the dataset."

      "summary": "Based on the comprehensive analysis, the upcoming draw is anticipated to lean towards low numbers and maintain a slight inclination towards even outcomes. Hot numbers '72', '07', and '03' are strongly suggested due to their consistent high frequency in the historical data, making them prime candidates for an appearance. Conversely, '99', '38', and '10' are identified as cold numbers, having appeared very rarely, which often indicates they are overdue. The digit '7' is projected as a key digit, given its dominant appearance rate in past draws. Furthermore, the pair digit '0' is predicted to be significant, reflecting its shared highest frequency in the historical pair digit analysis."
